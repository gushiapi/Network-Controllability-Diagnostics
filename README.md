# Network Controllability Diagnostics

This is the package for our published paper "Controllability of structural brain networks" (http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/151001/ncomms9414/full/ncomms9414.html). 

1. Please include the "GenLouvain2.0" in your directory. If it doesn't work, check the genlouvian/genlouvainmex function and the "Genvlouvian1.2" instead. 
2. To get the tiered values for each control strategy, run the corresponding averMeasTieredValsDirected.m, moduMeasTieredVals.m, getTieredControlStatesSH.m for the Average Controllability, Modal Controllability, and the Boundary Controllability. 

For any questions, feel free to contact gus_at_sas_dot_upenn_dot_edu.
