This is the package for our published paper "Controllability of structural brain networks" (http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/151001/ncomms9414/full/ncomms9414.html). 

1. Please include the "GenLouvain2.0" in your directory. If it doesn't work, check the genlouvian/genlouvainmex function and the "Genvlouvian1.2" instead.
